# Responsive-Portflio-Hamyz
I used HTML to create the structure of the website, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity. I created a responsive portfolio that looks great on all devices. I included sections for my bio, skills, work experience, and contact information. I made the portfolio easy to navigate and user-friendly.
I am proud of the work I did on this project and I believe it is a great representation of my skills as a web developer.
